# How to run the McXtrace debian based docker
Simply run the script docker_mxgui
- You will run as the user "docker" inside the docker.
- Currently the pyqtplot utilities do not work - nor does webgl.
- matplotlib plotting works though

## TODO still
1. change to use the users username etc instead of docker
2. mount the local home-directory as the home of the docker user.
